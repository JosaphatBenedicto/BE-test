Item 3.
Hypothetically, we are building an app that collects accelerometer 
data from thin clients (sensors with limited processing capacity)

    a. Assuming that the device is sending continuously at 16000Hz 
    for the X,Y, and Z acceleration measurements, what would your 
    strategy be in handling and processing the data? How would you 
    design the server infrastructure? Please enumerate the steps, 
    software, algorithms, and services that you would use to ensure 
    that the servers can handle the incoming data from our users. 
    Diagrams can be really helpful for this.

    b. If the sensors were upgraded to modern mobile devices, how would
    you change your architecture from A?
